# Pickles
 Python deserialization program for MacOS that allows reading and creating pickled data streams or executing pickled data. Can also be used for saving, storing, and recalling saved recursive models for use in AI.


Here’s a README.md template for a GitHub repository focusing on Pickle serialization in Python:

Pickles in Python

A repository demonstrating how to serialize and deserialize objects using Python’s pickle module. This project covers examples, security considerations, and practical use cases of Pickles.

Overview

Pickle is a built-in Python module used to serialize and deserialize Python objects into byte streams. Serialization allows objects to be stored or transferred and later reconstructed in the same or another environment.

This repository demonstrates:

    •    How to use Pickle for serialization.
    •    Security considerations when using untrusted data.
    •    Common use cases, including saving models, sessions, or cached data.

Installation

Pickle is included with the standard Python library. No additional installation is required. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Check your Python version:

python --version

Usage

1. Serializing (Pickling) an Object

import pickle

data = {"name": "Kevin", "age": 29, "skills": ["Python", "Swift"]}

# Serialize the data to a file
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(data, file)

print("Data has been serialized to 'data.pkl'")

2. Deserializing (Unpickling) an Object

import pickle

# Load the data from the pickle file
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    loaded_data = pickle.load(file)

print("Deserialized Data:", loaded_data)

Examples

    1.    Saving a Machine Learning Model
Use Pickle to save a trained model:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import pickle

model = LinearRegression().fit([[1, 2], [2, 3]], [3, 5])
with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)


    2.    Loading the Model for Prediction

with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(f)

print(loaded_model.predict([[3, 5]]))



Security Considerations

⚠️ Warning: Pickle can execute arbitrary code, which makes it unsafe to deserialize data from untrusted sources.
Always validate or sanitize inputs before using them. If you need safe serialization, consider alternatives such as JSON or MessagePack.

Example of unsafe behavior:

# Dangerous: This could execute malicious code
pickle.loads(b"cos\nsystem\n(S'echo Hacked!'\ntR.")
